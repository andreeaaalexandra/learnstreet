Welcome! Here is a Mastermind project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using ruby.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

Test your code-breaking mojo with Mastermind, a two-player strategy game that challenges you to solve your opponent's secret combinations. In this project, you will write the code that checks your guesses and gives you feedback until you figure it out!


Try it out!
